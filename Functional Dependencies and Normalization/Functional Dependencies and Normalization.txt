-----------------------------
Teams
1. team_id -> team_name
2. team_id -> coach_id
3. coach_id -> team_id 
4. coach_id -> team_name
-----------------------------
Referees
1. referee_id -> referee_name
2. referee_id -> referee_nationality
3. referee_id -> birth_date
-----------------------------
Coaches
1. coach_id -> coach_name
2. coach_id -> birth_date
-----------------------------
Stadiums
1. stadium_id -> stadium_location
2. stadium_id -> stadium_name
3. stadium_id -> stadium_capacity
-----------------------------
Goals
1. goal_id -> goal_minute
2. goal_id -> player_id
-----------------------------
Players
1. player_id -> player_name
2. player_id -> player_position
3. player_id -> birth_date
4. player_id -> team_id
-----------------------------
Teams_Matches
1. {team_id,match_id} -> final_score
-----------------------------

Normalization : 

- All relations satisfy 1NF since there are no composite or multi-valued attributes. 
- All relations satisfy 2NF since all relations are in 1NF and they do not contain any partial dependency.
- All relations are in 3NF since there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes as well as they are in second normal form. 
- All relations are in BCNF because for every functional dependency X -> Y in all relations, X is a superkey.
